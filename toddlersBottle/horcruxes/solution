Create the exploit by redirecting exploit.py to a file (exp),
and then run the following command on pwnable.kr server:
	(cat exp; cat) | nc 0 9032)

After you get all the horcruxes with the EXP numbers, user ./calc_exp
to calculate the total EXP.

Feed it to the program and you will get the flag.

And the flag is:
	Magic_spell_1s_4vad4_K3daVr4!
